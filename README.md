Compile for esp32 dev module

Right now it is printing out a bunch of zeros, if it worked correctly it would print out seemingly random hex numbers.

Should have no complie errors

Probably can't replicate the issue unless you have two lora radios, but hopefully you can spot the issues none the less

## Thanks!!!
